Hiring Manager
Chester County Intermediate Unit

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the [IT Support / Cybersecurity Analyst / Entry-Level Network Administrator] position at Chester County Intermediate Unit. I bring a strong foundation in IT and cybersecurity through the Google IT Support Professional Certificate and current training in the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, along with hands-on experience in network administration, system security, and IT support.

My professional background in logistics, medical compliance, and military communications has given me proven strengths in problem-solving, compliance, data security, and teamwork. I have worked in environments that demanded precision, regulatory adherence (HIPAA, DOT), and reliability, which directly translates to safeguarding systems and supporting secure IT operations.

I am eager to apply my technical training, certifications, and disciplined work ethic to support Chester County Intermediate Unit’s IT and cybersecurity goals. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills align with your team’s needs.

Sincerely,
Adrian Chatham
